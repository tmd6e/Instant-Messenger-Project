The repository contains a 'InstantMessenger' .exe application that can be ran to test. 
The application contains two distinct features: starting a chatroom and joining a chatroom.
Starting a chatroom will designate the user as a server to host incoming clients if they're provided the server's IP address and port. The IP address can either be retrieved via two different buttons on the interface or manually inputed by the server's user.
Joining a chatroom will designate the user as a client to use a server as a medium of communication to other clients given the server's IP address and port.
If the chatroom server disconnects, all clients will disconnect.
